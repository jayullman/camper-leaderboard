# camper-leaderboard

Objective:
Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can see a table of the Free Code Camp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.

User Story: I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.

User Story: I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.

Things learned:
Getting more used to seperating logic into seperate modules. I put all of the
AJAX request in requestJSON.js module

Made heavy use of ternary operator when determining what to display in the
component render functions
